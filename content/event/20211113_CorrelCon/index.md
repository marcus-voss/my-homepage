summary: "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) provide powerful tools to tackle climate change in various applications: They can support climate change mitigation, for instance, by helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions within various applications. They can help to adapt to a changing climate and even advance climate science itself. However, AI and ML are not silver bullets and can always only be one part of the solution. This talk provides an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of ML, some example applications and recurring themes."
