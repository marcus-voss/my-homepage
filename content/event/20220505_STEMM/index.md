summary: "Recent years have shown that trees, especially in big cities, have to face strenuous conditions due to missing rainfalls, rising temperatures and long-lasting droughts. But also environmental urban factors such as sealed surfaces, diverse soil types, dog excrements and reflecting house facades impact the tree’s wellbeing. In our talk, we will introduce you to the publicly funded project ‘QTrees’ and to our methods that we use to connect human and botanical intelligences with AI to implement solutions to support the effective watering and care of city trees. Furthermore, we show how the usage of machine learning can bridge the gap between local IoT sensors and physics-informed soil water balance models."
