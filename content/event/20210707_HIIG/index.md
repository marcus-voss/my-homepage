summary: AI provides powerful tools to tackle climate change in various applications â€“ but it is not a silver bullet. It can support the mitigation of climate change, for instance, by helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions within various applications. It can support adapting to a changing climate. AI can even support climate science itself. However, it can also be used to harm the climate. To avoid that, AI applications should be developed in collaboration and ongoing exchange with the communities that will use or are otherwise affected by the technology to avoid unforeseen impacts and drawbacks.
